# Project Readme

This JavaScript code creates a simple game that involves a car moving along a road while avoiding obstacles. The game uses an AI algorithm to control the car's movement, which is trained using a neural network.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you will need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and HTML. You will also need to have a web browser that supports the HTML5 canvas element.

To get started, simply copy the code into a new HTML file and save it to your computer. Then, open the file in your web browser to start playing the game.

## Code Overview

The code uses the following variables and functions:

- `carCanvas` and `networkCanvas`: These variables store references to the HTML canvas elements used for drawing the game and the neural network visualization, respectively.

- `carCtx` and `networkCtx`: These variables store references to the 2D rendering contexts for the canvas elements.

- `road`: This variable stores a new `Road` object, which represents the road that the car will travel along.

- `N`: This variable stores the number of cars to generate for the game.
